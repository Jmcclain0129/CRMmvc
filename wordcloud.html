                    <h5>The reasoning behind this project:</h5>
                    <p>If you've found this page that's a pretty good indication you have been ruthlessly venturing through our trust vacuum with great effect. We appreciate you're efforts thus far. The reason for the tag clouds are twofold with a 3rd being more of an admission than a reason</p>
                    <row>
                    <h5>Why we use word clouds in certain sections of the site:</h5>
                    <p>We believe the mixed fonts along with the various character sizes and weights plays a symbolic but useful role in helping you memorize the lessons we're trying to instill upon you because you are having to concentrate on the tag cloud messages more than you would on normal strings of text. Simply put, the tag clouds are forcing you to concentrate on the messenging we are wanting you to focus the most on.</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>Beyond just wordclouds:</h5>
                    <p>Before you get all bent out of shape (like our tag clouds are) because you think we pulled one over on you its important to note that there is a substantially better reason for using the tag cloud. Since our messaging is not that rich in keyword strings we felt it neccessary to include the tag cloud feature so that we could wrap our meta data around that feature which we believe will help deliver key information faster and more effectively to the search engine spiders who are routinely crawling these pages. Ingenious don't you think :-). We don't think so, but you might. In reality its just us doing due diligence and working a wee bit harder to ensure we get the biggest bang for our buck. If you hire us to develop your CRM we'll be sure to use little tricks like this as often as possible to spice up your projects organic SEO, at least on the forward facing pages..</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>How important is navigation and how can you influence it:</h5>
                    <p>The last reason isn't so much about tag clouds as it is behavior. The link that got you to this page can only be found on one page in our entire site. It is the most likely bounce page (the page people leave our site on most often) because it is asking you to click or tap yet another link. Since the user experience we have decided to deploy may seem random and likely unorthodox to most users we felt the need to provide a page like this to highlight our personality as developers. We truly do have a method in mind and we are very principled at defining it. This page is simply here to convey to you that we are always thinking outside the box and hopefully its little nuances like this that will ultimately gain your trust and encourage you to let us earn a spot on your development team.</p>
