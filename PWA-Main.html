            <p class="text-justify">PWA stands for Progressive Web App. Soon enough all native mobile apps will be converted to a PWA and the old school native apps will go the way of the 8-track, cassette, cd and so on. It's the new generation of cutting edge technology and has a boatload of advanced features that until now were only accessible via a native mobile app. The most handy of these is of course the ability to send notifications as IM's (instant messages). Try having your current mobile responsive website pull that trick off. Basically, a PWA has all the benefits of a native IOS or Android Mobile App without having to actually pay to develop the app or host it on the native app platforms. Your customers can simply load your PWA from your website just like you just did with our PWA.</p>

As we mentioned early on this is because we wanted to the project to be presented to you as an early stage MVP. We wanted to show functionality before all the glitter. However, we love color and beuatiful things just like anyone else. To prove it we've created our very own pictures of the day app <a href=/gallery.html>click here</a> to view them.</p>
