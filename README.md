## General info
This project is a simple MVP (minimum viable product) designed to showcase what an MVP might look like if my company were to design one for a customer of ours. The principle is to focus on delivering functionality rather than design in the earliest stages of development so that you can get to market faster and present the product to early adopters in the hopes of gaining feedback as it relates to the navigation and useability of the site.

Because this project is based on an MVP approach the traditional design elements and decoration of text elements buttons, borders and so on have not been the focus of what I intended to achive by developing this early stage prototype.

The focus of the project is to impress upon visitors to the site that the company specialises in developing early stage cloud based CRM Customer Relationship Management systems designed with MVC Model View Controller methodology to arrive at a phase 1 iteration that delivers the minimum amount of functionality to bring the product to market.
