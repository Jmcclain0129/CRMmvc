                    <h5>What is a CRM? Customer Relationship Manager</h5>
                    <p>A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes and improve profitability</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>What is an MVC: Model view controller</h5>
                    <p>Model-View-Controller is an architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts.</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>What is an MVP: Minimum Viable Product</h5>
                    <p>Minimum Viable Product or MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development.</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>What is a PWA: Progressive Web App</h5>
                    <p>Progressive Web Applications load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications and device hardware access traditionally available only to native applications.</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>How does a PWA Work Offline</h5>
                    <p>Save data in forms using your browser's memory. Google Chrome offers unlimited storage while Apple Safari is limited to 50mb but that will change soon enough. Ask for more details about this feature and how your company can benefit from it.</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>How does a PWA Push Notifications</h5>
                    <p>You can send notices via your web app to your customers who have the PWA app installed on their homescreens. Notices appear as alerts so those users who have alerts active receive the message on their screen. This works on PC, tablets and mobile devices. The red badge with number of notices also appears so the user knows how many messages are queued</p>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <h5>How do I load a PWA onto my computer, tablet or mobile device</h5>
                    <p>If a website is constructed as a PWA it should prompt you to download its script after your first couple of visits. If you can't wait then use your save to homescreen feature if you are on a mobile app. If all else fails contact the sites publisher.</p>
